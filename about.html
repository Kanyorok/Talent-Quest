            Our History
          </h3>
          <p class="mt-4 mb-0">
            Talent Quest Sports was founded in 2021 from the streets of kibera
            slums,which later spread its wings in the slums of
            Kanjeru,kawangware ,kikuyu and Kabete. with a vision of identifying
            and developing talent within the area. Through this and soccer as
            its main sport, a greater target of putting kids in schools and
            involving them in mentorship programs was born. This has been a
            massive success with a bigger obligation to serve the community that
            made us the prime obligation. We have won multiple trophies since
            2021 across all categories. Most notably the East Africa Cup – u15
            category. Our players have gone on to achieve greater heights as
            well. Micheal Wanyama currently based in Sweden and plays for the
            Kenya national team, Stephen and Suleiman - were part of Kasi Kasi
            FC, Moriah Magoma - Currently with Juventus Academy in Qatar and
            DavidAnWdaweru - earned an educational scholarship with Al Saad.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Born and bred in Kibera and Kawangware slums, John developed a
            passion for soccer from a very early age. This led him to come up
            with the Talent Quest Sports Academy in 2021. A program that started
            from the streets of Kibera and Kawangware Slums and grew its wings
            to the slams of Kanjeru,kabete and Kikuyu into the soccer academy it
            is now serving the kids and youths of Kiambu into their sports
            career development. The challenge of getting basic training
            equipment, soccer boots for kids and youth was so huge that nearly
            made him give up but with a will so strong, his desire never left,
            His passion never suffered but only grew stronger.<br />
            <br />Talent Quest has evolved to be more than a soccer academy to a
            community based organization namely the worthy pursuit that support
            kids and youths in the slums to pursue education,community
            development,Creating awareness about drug and substance abuse among
            the youths while chasing their soccer dreams. Started out with kids
            in Kibera but expanded to Kawangware ,Kanjeru and Kabete . We have
            put over 50 kids in high schools on scholarships, 35 are being
            supported in primary schools and 2 in Universities. This has been a
            major step in the right direction. Now, we have sights on something
            bigger. Bigger than our existence. Something for a game that has
            given us so much. One that has the power to uAnn itd e, inspire and
            make a whole new generation dream

                At TQS Football Academy we consider it is our primary
                responsibility to make sure that players have fun whilst
                developing as footballers, which should hopefully instil in them
                a long term love for the game and love for each other as it is
                all for sportsmanship. We do not measure the performance of
                coaches in wins and losses, but rather in what players learn in
                terms of technique, sportsmanship and fair play. Our managers,
                coaches and officials are charged with the responsibility of
                controlling their players at all times during a match or
                training and will lead and teach by example.
